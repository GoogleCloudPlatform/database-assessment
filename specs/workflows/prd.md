# Standard Operating Procedure: PRD Workflow

This workflow begins when the user invokes `/prompt prd`. The agent must analyze the request, consult existing project code and guides, and then generate the full workspace structure and planning documents within `specs/active/`. The output must be a self-contained plan ready for implementation.
