# This file is provided as a template to be used for simple automation of the DMA collector. 
# Use one line per database.
# Any whitepace will be removed during file parsing.
# The fields are comma-separated.  DO NOT USE PASSWORDS CONTAINING A COMMA OR OTHER CHARACTERS THAT MAY BE INTERPRETED BY THE SHELL.
# Field 1 = Username and password for a user with SYSDBA privileges.
# Field 2 = Username and password to create and use for the DMA collector. Note that the dma_make_user.sh script will create the user if it does not already exist.
# Field 3 = Connection details for the database in Easy Connect format.
# Field 4 = Source for performance stats (Must be one of AWR, STATSPACK, NOSTATS).
# Field 5 = Number of days of statistics to collect. (Must be one of 7 or 30) 
# Field 6 = Optional. Unique identifier for this database, up to 30 characters, no spaces or punctuation other than underscore.  Optional, but must be unique if specified.
# Field 7 = Optional. Flag to indicate whether to run Oracle Estate Explorer (if available) collection on this database.  Default is N.
# Field 8 = Optional. Group name to use for this database within Oracle Estate Explorer,  up to 30 characters, no spaces or punctuation.
# NOTE THAT ORACLE ESTATE EXPLORER MUST BE DOWNLOADED SEPARATELY FROM ORACLE.  It is optional and not required for DMA collector to run.

# The first example below demonstrates how to connect to a non-container database and use STATSPACK performance data. Unique identifier is "prodSales", Oracle Estate Explorer will be collected and this database will be in group "PROD"
# The second example demonstrates how to create a common user for a container database and use AWR/ASH data for performance stats. Unique identifier is "prodInventory", Oracle Estate Explorer will be collected and this database will be in group "PROD"
# The third example demonstrates how to connect to a non-container database and skip collection of performance data. Unique identifier is "qa1", Oracle Estate Explorer will be collected and this database will be in group "QA"
# The fourth example demonstrates how to connect to a non-container database and skip collection of performance data. No unique identifier is defined and Oracle Estate Explorer will not be run on this database.
