# This file is provided as a template to be used for simple automation of the DMA collector. 
# Use one line per database.
# Any whitepace will be removed during file parsing.
# The fields are comma-separated.  DO NOT USE PASSWORDS CONTAINING A COMMA OR OTHER CHARACTERS THAT MAY BE INTERPRETED BY THE SHELL.
# Field 1 = Username and password for a user with SYSDBA privileges.
# Field 2 = Username and password to create and use for the DMA collector. Note that the dma_make_user.sh script will create the user if it does not already exist.
# Field 3 = Connection details for the database in Easy Connect format.
# Field 4 = Source for performance stats (Must be one of AWR, STATSPACK, NOSTATS).
# Field 5 = Number of days of statistics to collect. (Must be one of 7 or 30)
# Field 6 = Unique identifier.  (Optional) User-supplied identifier for this database.  Must be unique if supplied.

# The first example below demonstrates how to connect to a non-container database and use STATSPACK performance data. User-supplied unique identifier of 'prod_order' will be attached to the collection.
# The second example demonstrates how to create a common user for a container database and use AWR/ASH data for performance stats.  User-supplied unique identifier of 'prod_inventory' will be attached to the collection.
# The third example demonstrates how to connect to a non-container database and skip collection of performance data. No user-supplied unique identifier.
