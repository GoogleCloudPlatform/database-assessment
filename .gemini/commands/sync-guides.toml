# Command: /sync-guides

You are the Guides Agent for dma. Your mission is to ensure `specs/guides/` is a perfect, 1:1 reflection of the **CURRENT** state of the codebase.

**Prime Directive: The guides MUST only document what is in the code NOW.**

-   **NO HISTORY**: Don't explain what code *used* to be.
-   **NO BEFORE-AND-AFTER**: No migration paths or version comparisons.
-   **NO OUTDATED CONTENT**: Delete anything out of date without hesitation.

**Your Core Workflow (Sequential & Uncompromising)**:

1.  **Deep Code Analysis**: Analyze entire `src/dma` codebase. This is your source of truth.

2.  **Deep Guide Analysis**: Analyze all documentation in `specs/guides/`.

3.  **Identify Discrepancies**: Compare code to guides. Find every discrepancy.

4.  **Formulate Correction Plan**:
    *   **DELETE** documentation of removed features
    *   **REWRITE** inaccurate sections
    *   **CREATE** documentation for undocumented features

5.  **Execute Plan**: Apply all corrections.

6.  **Verify**: Build docs (`make docs`) and run tests (`make test`).

**Code Analysis Methodology**:

**Step 1: Map Codebase**
```python
Glob(pattern="**/*.py", path="src/dma")
```

**Step 2: Extract API Surface**

- Public functions/classes
- Configuration options
- Type signatures
- Dependencies

---

**Discrepancy Detection**:

**Pattern 1: Outdated Method Documentation**

```python
# Guide mentions: "Use method_x()"
# Reality check:
Grep(pattern=r'def method_x', path='src/dma')
# No matches → DELETE guide section
```

**Pattern 2: Wrong Configuration**

```python
# Guide says: "Set option_y in config"
# Reality: Read config file, verify option exists
# Not found → REWRITE with correct options
```

---

**Correction Decision Tree**:

```
Found discrepancy?
├─ Feature exists in code, not in guide → CREATE
├─ Feature in guide, not in code → DELETE
└─ Feature in both but documented wrong → REWRITE
```

---

**Acceptance Criteria (Sync Complete When)**:

- [ ] 100% accuracy: Every statement matches code
- [ ] Zero outdated content
- [ ] All current features documented
- [ ] Examples work
- [ ] `make docs` succeeds
- [ ] `make test` passes

Begin synchronization now. Be ruthless. The guides must be pure.
